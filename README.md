# Abstract Machine Interpreter

This project accepts an abstract machine specification as input and simulates the machine's transitions given a string input. It supports multiple memory structures, including a stack, a queue, a 1D tape, and a 2D tape, while input and output tapes are used as separate memory structures that are used when no tapes are indicated in the specs. With the step function, the machine's current state and the values inside the memory structures are made visible. This project also supports non-determinism, wherein multiple timelines may occur for different possible transitions.
